## Made an already incredible game even more incredible!
_Reviewed By: MagicMaster667 on 01 Aug 2024_

>They say that you don’t know what you want until you get it… and this improvement hack was certainly that for me! A rumbling world of fun and excellence was revealed to me with this hack on my ez-flash Definitive Edition. It was an experience I can only liken to a religious awakening to experience one of my favorite platformers in an upgraded way.

>I didn’t try this out to have my mind blown, but lo and behold - it feels SO good and IMPACTFUL to play the game this way that it compelled me to create an account here just so I could throw a up a positive review. I can’t recommend this enough!! :^)

Version 0.9b Recommended - Yes

## Absolutely incredible hack that brings a whole new dimension!
_Reviewed By: supertazon on 16 Nov 2023_

>Hack flashed on an insideGadgets’ rumble GBA flashcart. Fantastic job on the hack, it is polished beyond words! I was expecting simple rumble here and there, and instead the rumble intensity and duration is completely fine-tuned to each different trigger (stomping on an enemy, getting hit…). The fine tuning truly provides a new dimension to the game! Now I want to try all the other rumble patches by djedditt! 100% recommend

Version 0.9b Recommended - Yes

## BRRRR-avo!!!

>Excellent use of the rumble! I tried it on EZ Flash ODE, and it feels good. You can truly feel the quakes of Wario’s ground pounding.

Version 0.9b Recommended - Yes

## I love this!
_Reviewed By: Frinkenstein789 on 22 Oct 2023_

>Works well. Adds a nice dimension to an already great game. Highly recommend and tasteful hack.

Version 0.9b Recommended - Yes

## Works perfectly, tastefully done.
_Reviewed By: Nuclear_Muffin on 04 Sep 2023_

>Exactly as advertised, it adds rumble support in exactly the places you would expect from an official Nintendo product. It even goes so far as to add the official Game Boy Player splash screen to the start of the game! Feels like it was done by Nintendo themselves, EXCELLENT-AH!
>
>One thing to note, if you’re using this with an Analogue Pocket, be sure to apply the included Hex patch AFTER you have already applied the Rumble .ips patch, or else it won’t work. Afterwards? It works flawlessly.
>
>I hope the author starts adding rumble to other GBA titles after this, have been wanting something like this for years, as the GBA’s rumble functionality (much like its Wireless Adapter support) was always criminally underutilised during its lifespan.

Version 0.9b Recommended - Yes

## It ever works on Miyoo Mini and Plus version!

>I didn’t expect it actually works on Miyoo Mini and Miyoo Mini Plus, I tried RG351M, RG351MP in many firmwares and none of them works, I tried RGB20s and GKD Mini, not working, but with Miyoo Mini and Miyoo Mini Plus, it works perfectly. Firmware version Onion v4.2.0-beta-dev-4c7e2db Hope someone who has it try it on and have the great experience of Wario Land 4 - Jungle Rumble!

Version 0.9b Recommended - Yes

## This one is a must!
_Reviewed By: CMDreamer on 27 Aug 2023_

>This hack changes the experience of playing the game completely!
>
>Now we have the chance to feel for real the game as Nintendo should’ve done it in the first place (with a rumble pack included on the cartridge ofc), but that was not very common back in the day this game was released.
>
>Absolutely recommended even if you already finished it!
>
>Note: I’m using an 8BitDo SN30 Pro USB gamepad and at first I thought the hack didn’t worked, but this gamepad has rumble disabled by default, so we need to press this button combination once: L + R + Select and the gamepad will rumble shortly to confirm it has been enabled, by pressing the button combination once again rumble will be disabled without any confirmation from the gamepad (it will not rumble).

Version 0.9b Recommended - Yes

## A very cool addition to a great game!
_Reviewed By: ImNotAnEggplant on 26 Aug 2023_

>I decided to give this hack a shot on my homebrewed Switch running mGBA. The addition of rumble really does make playing the game a little more immersive! I only played it for a few minutes, but feeling some weight behind Wario’s movements, along with the impacts of the mechanical presses in The Curious Factory stage give this classic a new shine.
>
>Out of curiosity I tested patching it to a copy of Wario Land 4 - Parallel Worlds (a fantastic hack made by beco), but it didn’t work regardless of which patch was applied first.
>
>I would recommend this hack to give your next playthrough of Wario Land 4 an extra something special! It seems to work on homebrew emulators that have rumble, so I imagine it’d work on the likes of a Wii or other consoles! E-e-e-excellent work!

Version 0.9b Recommended - Yes

## EXCELLENT-A!
_Reviewed By: Valkyrie on 24 Aug 2023_

>This patch delivers exactly what it promises with flying colors - the relatively light rumble works surprisingly well accentuating every move Wario does in the game for highly immersive experience.
>
>Highly recommended for anyone looking to revisit this beloved title with supported platform or cart - being burly, greedy plumber has never felt more real on your own hands!

Version 0.9a Recommended - Yes

## A wonderfull hack that uses Rumble with flair.
_Reviewed By: Auyx on 24 Aug 2023_

>This hack is great! It uses the rumble on my EZ Flash Omega with subtlety and class. Feels like it was programmed by Nintendo themselves. I am so happy to see more of this kind of mod and would like to express my thanks to the devs.

Version 0.9a Recommended - Yes

## Absolutely Amazing
_Reviewed By: r1ggles on 22 Aug 2023_

>If there’s one GBA game that should’ve had rumble it’s this one! Wario is such a weighty character with a ton of power, smashing rocks and bashing enemies. With rumble it all feels even more physical and impactful. This patch is a must and worth getting a flashcart etc with a rumble feature for. Professional work!

Version 0.9 Recommended - Yes

## Perfect
_Reviewed By: orangeglo on 22 Aug 2023_

>This hack takes an already fantastic game and pushes it over the top! If you have a way to experience rumble enabled games, this is a must have. You can really feel the amount of effort that went into making this feel like an official feature!

Version 0.9 Recommended - Yes
