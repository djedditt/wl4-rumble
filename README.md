# Wario Land 4: Jungle Rumble!

If youâ€™re a Wario Land 4 fan, get ready to bump up your treasure hunting and boss battling experience to a new level of fun. The "Jungle Rumble!" patch brings comprehensive rumble support to the original Game Boy Advance classic, by providing tactile feedback for many in-game actions and events.

## Game Boy Player Compatibility

- GameCube with Game Boy Player
